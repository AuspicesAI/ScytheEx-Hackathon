## System Workflow

### 1. Front-end Initialization

- The React-based front-end is served to users, providing a dashboard for monitoring network traffic, alerts, and analytics.
- Users can interact with the UI to customize settings or initiate specific analyses.

### 2. Back-end and Traffic Monitoring

- The back-end, written in C, captures real-time network traffic data from the operating system.
- This component parses the network packets to extract relevant data fields as specified (e.g., protocol, service, state).

### 3. Data Storage with Redis

- Extracted data from the back-end is pushed to a Redis database, which acts as a real-time data store.
- Redis is configured to handle high-throughput and low-latency operations to ensure timely analysis.

### 4. AI Model Analysis

- The Python-based AI model periodically retrieves network traffic data from Redis.
- The model analyzes the data, applying machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies or potential threats based on predefined rules and metrics.

### 5. Result Processing and Response

- Analysis results are pushed back to another Redis instance or the same with different data structuring, which might include threat levels, types of attacks detected, and other relevant metrics.
- Depending on the results, automated mitigation strategies may be triggered (if implemented).

### 6. Front-end Updates and User Interaction

- The front-end continuously polls or listens for updates from Redis to display the latest analysis and alerts.
- Users can view detailed reports, adjust system settings, or manually intervene in response to specific threats.

### 7. Ongoing Monitoring and Updates

- The system constantly monitors network traffic, with AI models adapting to new data and evolving threats.
- System updates and new threat intelligence can be rolled out to enhance detection and response capabilities.

### 8. Logging and Auditing

- All actions, from traffic logging to alert responses, are documented for auditing and improvement purposes.
- Logs are crucial for understanding past incidents and refining system performance and security measures.

## Optional Components

### Mitigation Logic

- If a threat is detected, automated or suggested mitigation responses can be activated to protect the system.

### Threat Intelligence Integration

- Real-time data can be enriched with external threat intelligence feeds to improve detection accuracy.
