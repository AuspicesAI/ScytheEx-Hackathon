## Overview

ScytheEx is an advanced cybersecurity tool designed for real-time network traffic monitoring and threat analysis. Initially developed as a Linux service daemon and capable of deployment on Kubernetes bare metal, this versatile solution extends its functionality across various operating systems.

ScytheEx integrates AI-driven analytics to detect activities post-attack, adhering to the philosophy that despite advanced protective measures like EDR or AV, malware may still execute on the system. The tool operates at this post-execution level to identify malicious activities and generate YARA rules, providing continuous feeds to enhance other detection tools and technologies.

> [!Warning]
> ScytheEx project is still in an early stage which means that any feature changes are very welcome. Also note that anything can break, stable release is still not close.

## Setup Instructions

### Kubernetes Deployment using Helm

> [!Important]
> By default, **ScytheEx** runs as a daemonset on Kubernetes and is not fully tested which may break; Kubernetes admins can customize the deployment as needed.

1. **Prepare Your Environment**:

   - Ensure Kubernetes cluster is set up and `kubectl` is configured.
   - Install Helm on your system.

2. **Deploy ScytheEx**:
   - Clone the repository and navigate to the Helm chart directory.
   - Modify the values in `values.yaml` as necessary, particularly the network interfaces and Redis settings.
   - Run `helm install scytheex ./scytheex-chart` to deploy to your Kubernetes cluster.

### Debian-Based Linux Host Setup

1. **Installation**:

   - Use the following command to install ScytheEx directly:
     ```bash
     curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AuspicesAI/ScytheEx/main/setup/debian_linux.sh | sudo bash
     ```
   - This script will clone the ScytheEx repository, install Python dependencies, set up the environment, and configure ScytheEx as a systemd service.

2. **Enable Service**:
   - Run `systemctl enable scytheex` to enable the ScytheEx service to automatically start at boot time.

### Windows Host Setup

> [!Warning]
> Still not tested, will probably break.

1. **Download and Install**:

   - Download the latest release from the [ScytheEx Repository](https://github.com/AuspicesAI/ScytheEx/releases).
   - Ensure Python is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [Python's official site](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Open a command prompt as Administrator and navigate to the directory where ScytheEx is downloaded.
   - Install required Python dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Configure and Run**:
   - Open the `config.toml` file located in your ScytheEx installation directory.
   - Manually adjust the network interface settings under the appropriate section to correspond with your system.
   - Run `setup_windows.bat` to configure and start ScytheEx as a service. Make sure to run the command prompt as Administrator.
