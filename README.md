## Overview

ScytheEx is an advanced cybersecurity tool designed for real-time network traffic monitoring and threat analysis. Initially developed as a Linux service daemon and capable of deployment on Kubernetes bare metal, this versatile solution extends its functionality across various operating systems.

ScytheEx integrates AI-driven analytics to detect activities post-attack, adhering to the philosophy that despite advanced protective measures like EDR or AV, malware may still execute on the system. The tool operates at this post-execution level to identify malicious activities and generate YARA rules, providing continuous feeds to enhance other detection tools and technologies.

> [!Warning]
> ScytheEx project is still in an early stage which means that any feature changes are very welcome. Also note that anything can break, stable release is still not close.

### Kubernetes Deployment using Helm

> [!Important]
> by default **ScytheEx** runs as a daemonset on kubernetes and is not fully tested which may break, kubernetes admins can customize the deployment as needed.

1. **Prepare Your Environment**:

   - Ensure Kubernetes cluster is set up and `kubectl` is configured.
   - Install Helm on your system.

2. **Deploy ScytheEx**:
   - Clone the repository and navigate to the Helm chart directory.
   - Modify the values in `values.yaml` as necessary, particularly the network interfaces and Redis settings.
   - Run `helm install scytheex ./scytheex-chart` to deploy to your Kubernetes cluster.

![Debian](https://github.com/AuspicesAI/ScytheEx/assets/75253629/cddd869a-1080-45d9-8668-dc05b0d41ea6)

### Debian-Based Linux Host Setup

1. **Installation**:

   - Use the following command to install ScytheEx directly:
     ```bash
     curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AuspicesAI/ScytheEx/main/setup/debian_linux.sh | sudo bash
     ```
   - This script will clone the ScytheEx repository, install Python dependencies, set up the environment, and configure ScytheEx as a systemd service.

2. **Enable Service**:
   - Run `systemctl enable scytheex` to enable ScytheEx service to automatically start at boot time.

![Windows](https://github.com/AuspicesAI/ScytheEx/assets/75253629/e8cc8fba-903a-4f18-886b-4dab1ab8eeb7)

### Windows Host Setup

> [!Warning]
> Still not tested, will probably break.

1. **Download and Install**:

   - Download the latest release from [ScytheEx Repository](https://github.com/AuspicesAI/ScytheEx/releases).
   - Ensure Python is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [Python's official site](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Open a command prompt as Administrator and navigate to the directory where ScytheEx is downloaded.
   - Install required Python dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Configure and Run**:

   - Open the `config.toml` file located in your ScytheEx installation directory.
   - Manually adjust the network interface settings under the appropriate section to correspond with your system.
   - Run `setup_windows.bat` to configure and start ScytheEx as a service. Make sure to run the command prompt as Administrator:
     ```bash
     setup_windows.bat
     ```

   **Note**: Configuration of network settings and service setup may require specific permissions or adjustments depending on your system's security settings.

## Configuration (`config.toml`)

## System Workflow

Detailed steps from initial data capture through to AI analysis and front-end interaction:

1. **Data Capture**:

   - ScytheEx captures network traffic on the specified interface.
   - Traffic data is stored in Redis for real-time analysis.

2. **AI Analysis**:

   - The AI engine processes the traffic data to identify potential threats.
   - Identified threats are stored in Redis for further processing.

3. **Threat Detection**:

   - ScytheEx uses the AI-generated threat data to detect malicious activities.
   - Detected threats are logged and can trigger mitigation strategies.

4. **Front-End Interaction**:

   - The visualization server provides a front-end interface for monitoring and interacting with the system.
   - Users can view real-time traffic data, threat alerts, and system status.

5. **Mitigation Strategies**:

   - ScytheEx can automatically respond to threats based on severity.
   - Mitigation strategies include IP blacklisting and other automated responses.

6. **Threat Intelligence**:

   - ScytheEx can integrate with real-time threat intelligence feeds to enhance detection capabilities.
   - Threat intelligence data is used to identify and respond to emerging threats.

7. **Customization**:

   - Users can customize the configuration file to adjust system behavior.
   - Custom settings include network interfaces, logging paths, and performance optimizations.

8. **Deployment**:

   - ScytheEx can be deployed on Kubernetes clusters or standalone Linux and Windows systems.
   - Deployment options include Helm charts for Kubernetes and setup scripts for Linux and Windows.

9. **Monitoring**:

   - ScytheEx continuously monitors network traffic and system status.
   - Real-time alerts and logs provide visibility into potential threats and system performance.

10. **Scalability**:
    - ScytheEx is designed to scale across multiple nodes and handle high volumes of traffic.
    - The system can be customized to meet the needs of large-scale deployments.

## Future Enhancements

- **Mitigation Strategies**: Automated system responses based on threat severity.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Integration with real-time threat intelligence feeds to enhance detection capabilities.
- **Kubernetes Response**: Future feature to cordon off and drain infected Kubernetes nodes, preventing the spread of malware and automatically redistributing workloads.
